# Eyesing

The common mispronunciation of the widely used Ising model of ferromagnetism. This framework for generative visuals explores the potentials of the physics-based model (and some of its extensions) for pattern generation, adaptative and self-organisational behaviour. The goal is to use it as a tool for live performances, but also to engage with emergent phenomena in a playful way.
